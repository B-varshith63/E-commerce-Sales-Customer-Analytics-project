## Step 1 — Data Cleaning (Python)

**Notebook:** `notebooks/Python_data_cleaning.ipynb`

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Removed duplicates | Based on Transaction_ID |
| Handled null values | Dropped critical nulls, filled numeric nulls with 0 |
| Fixed date format | Parsed to datetime, extracted Year/Month/Quarter |
| Removed negatives | Revenue ≥ 0, Units_Sold > 0 |
| Standardized text | Title case for Category and Region |
| Created new columns | Profit, Profit_Margin_Pct, Revenue_Per_Unit, ROAS |

**Output:** `ecommerce_cleaned.csv` — 100,000 rows × 24 columns

---

## Step 2 — SQL Analysis

**Notebook:** `notebooks/ecommerce_sql_analysis.ipynb`

### Sample Query
```sql
-- Monthly Revenue Trend
SELECT YearMonth, SUM(Revenue) AS Monthly_Revenue
FROM ecommerce
GROUP BY YearMonth
ORDER BY YearMonth;
```

### All Queries Built (12 total)

| Category | Queries |
|----------|---------|
| Sales | Total revenue, monthly trend, top 10 products, revenue by category/region |
| Customer | New vs repeat customers, top 10 customers, avg order value |
| Profitability | Profit by category, discount impact, monthly profit trend |
| Marketing | ROAS by category, ad spend efficiency |

**Output:** `results/ecommerce_sql_results.xlsx` — 5 sheets

---

## Step 3 — RFM Customer Segmentation

**Notebook:** `notebooks/ecommerce_rfm_analysis.ipynb`

Each of 19,865 customers scored **1–5** on:
- **R — Recency:** Days since last purchase (lower = better)
- **F — Frequency:** Number of orders (higher = better)
- **M — Monetary:** Total revenue generated (higher = better)

### Segment Results

| Segment | Customers | % of Base | Revenue | Avg Spend |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Champion | 3,295 | 16.6% | $15.2M | $4,620 |
| Loyal | 3,857 | 19.4% | $13.4M | $3,483 |
| Potential Loyal | 3,523 | 17.7% | $6.4M | $1,817 |
| Needs Attention | 3,709 | 18.7% | $6.3M | $1,709 |
| Cannot Lose | 1,396 | 7.0% | $6.0M | $4,303 |
| At Risk | 1,336 | 6.7% | $4.0M | $2,986 |
| Lost | 2,749 | 13.8% | $3.9M | $1,424 |

## Step 4 — Power BI Dashboard (4 Pages)

**File:** `dashboard/Ecommerce_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix`

| Page | Content |
|------|---------|
| 1️. Executive Overview | KPI cards, monthly trend, revenue by category & region |
| 2️. Product Performance | Top 10 products, revenue vs profit, profit margin % |
| 3️, Customer Analytics | RFM segments, top customers, new vs repeat (96.72% repeat!) |
| 4️. Geography Insights | Interactive map, revenue by region, region × category matrix |

## Key Business Insights

**1. Clothing Drives Highest Profit Margins**
> Clothing delivers 54.4% profit margin vs Home Appliances at 36.5%. Reallocating ad budget to Clothing improves overall profitability.

**2. Top 36% of Customers Drive 51.8% of Revenue**
> Champion customers (16.6%) generate $15.2M alone. A VIP loyalty program targeting this group directly protects the largest revenue segment.

**3. $6M At-Risk Revenue Needs Urgent Action**
> 1,396 "Cannot Lose" customers averaged $4,303 spend but have not purchased in 105 days. An urgent win-back campaign could recover $6M.

**4. Exceptional 96.72% Repeat Buyer Rate**
> Nearly all customers buy again — focus should shift to increasing basket size and order frequency rather than new customer acquisition.

**5. Revenue Peaks October–November**
> Monthly revenue peaks at $4.83M in November. Campaigns should be planned 6–8 weeks in advance to capture seasonal demand.

## Business Recommendations

| Priority | Action | Expected Impact |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Immediate | VIP loyalty program for 3,295 Champions | Protect $15.2M revenue |
