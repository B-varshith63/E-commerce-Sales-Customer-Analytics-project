# E-Commerce Analytics Project Report

**Data Period:** July 2023 – December 2024
**Total Transactions:** 100,000 | **Unique Customers:** 19,865 | **Unique Products:** 1,000

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a full end-to-end analysis of a synthetic e-commerce dataset covering roughly 18 months of transactions. The goal was straightforward — take raw transactional data, clean it up, run SQL-style aggregations, segment customers using RFM analysis, and tie everything together in a Power BI dashboard.

It's the kind of workflow you'd see in a real analyst role: messy data in, actionable insights out.

## 3. Data Cleaning

The raw dataset had 100,000 rows. First step was making sure the data was actually usable before doing any analysis — garbage in, garbage out.

**What was done:**

Removed duplicates based on Transaction_ID and dropped rows missing critical fields like Customer_ID, Transaction_Date, and Revenue. Any missing values in ad metrics (Clicks, Impressions, Ad_Spend, etc.) were filled with 0 rather than dropping rows — most of those were just transactions with no ad activity.

Dates were parsed and broken out into Year, Month, Quarter, and YearMonth columns — useful for slicing trends later. Negative Revenue and zero Units_Sold rows were filtered out. Ad_Spend negatives were flipped to positive using abs() since those were clearly data entry errors, not actual negative spends.

Category and Region strings were cleaned up with strip() and title() to make sure 'electronics' and 'Electronics' didn't get counted separately.

**New columns engineered:**

| Column | Formula | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Profit | Revenue - Ad_Spend | Bottom-line after advertising cost |
| Profit_Margin_Pct | (Profit / Revenue) x 100 | Margin as a percentage |
| Revenue_Per_Unit | Revenue / Units_Sold | Average selling price per unit |
| ROAS | Revenue / Ad_Spend | Return on Ad Spend efficiency |

After cleaning: still 100,000 rows — the dataset was actually quite clean to begin with, which is typical for synthetic data. In a real scenario you'd expect more issues.

## 4. SQL Analysis

After cleaning, SQL queries were run to answer the core business questions around revenue, profitability, and performance by category, region, and time.

**Overall Numbers:**

| Total Revenue | Total Profit | Total Orders | Overall ROAS |
|---|---|---|---|
| $55,311,081 | $44,263,357 | 100,000 | 5.01x |

Profit margin sitting at ~80% overall looks high, but remember this is profit after ad spend only — it doesn't account for COGS, fulfillment, or other operating costs. In a real business context you'd want to layer in those costs.

**Revenue by Category:**

| Category | Revenue | Profit | Margin % |
|---|---|---|---|
| Electronics | $11,326,820 | $8,944,388 | 45.9% |
| Books | $11,195,312 | $9,085,441 | 48.8% |
| Toys | $11,194,842 | $8,906,124 | 48.5% |
| Clothing | $11,034,899 | $8,911,515 | 54.4% |
| Home Appliances | $10,559,207 | $8,415,889 | 36.5% |

Revenue is remarkably even across all five categories — within about 7% of each other. Clothing actually has the best margin percentage at 54.4%, while Home Appliances lags behind at 36.5%, likely due to higher ad spend needed to drive conversions on big-ticket items.

**Revenue by Region:**

| Region | Revenue | Profit |
|---|---|---|
| Asia | $18,492,871 | $14,793,767 |
| North America | $18,419,229 | $14,731,567 |
| Europe | $18,398,981 | $14,738,023 |

Almost perfectly balanced across regions — which again is a sign of synthetic data. Real regional splits are rarely this even. That said, it tells us the model doesn't have a regional skew to worry about.

**Revenue Trend by Quarter:**

| Period | Revenue | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Q4 2023 | $3,723,070 | Partial quarter — data starts July 2023 |
| Q1 2024 | $13,683,188 | Strong start to full-year data |
| Q2 2024 | $13,666,755 | Stable, slight dip |
| Q3 2024 | $13,703,405 | Back up slightly |
| Q4 2024 (partial) | $10,534,663 | Oct–Dec only |

Q1 through Q3 2024 are very consistent at ~$13.7M per quarter, which is good stability. Q4 2024 looks lower but it's a partial period (the data ends mid-December), so that's not a real decline.

## 5. RFM Customer Segmentation

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary — it's a classic way to segment customers based on their buying behavior. Each customer gets a score of 1–4 on each dimension, then those scores get combined to assign them a segment.

The dataset has 19,865 unique customers. Here's how they broke down:

| Segment | Count | % of Customers | What it means |
|---|---|---|---|
| Loyal | 3,857 | 19.4% | Frequent buyers who've purchased recently |
| Needs Attention | 3,709 | 18.7% | Were good customers, starting to slip |
| Potential Loyal | 3,523 | 17.7% | Recent buyers with growth potential |
| Champion | 3,295 | 16.6% | Best customers — recent, frequent, high spend |
| Lost | 2,749 | 13.8% | Haven't bought in a long time |
| Cannot Lose | 1,396 | 7.0% | High-value but lapsed — urgent retention targets |
| At Risk | 1,336 | 6.7% | Previously good, showing drop-off signs |

**Key Takeaways from RFM:**

Champions and Loyal customers together make up about 36% of the customer base — that's a solid foundation of engaged buyers. The strategy there is retention: keep these people happy, don't over-discount them.

"Cannot Lose" is only 7% of customers but probably a disproportionate share of revenue. These are high-value customers who've gone quiet. Win-back campaigns — personalized offers, re-engagement emails — should be prioritized here.

"Needs Attention" at 18.7% is a warning sign segment. These customers haven't fallen off completely but they're trending that way. Proactive outreach is the play before they move into At Risk or Lost.

"Lost" at 13.8% — realistically, some of these won't come back. But a subset may respond to deep discounts or compelling offers, so a carefully targeted win-back could recover some revenue without burning margins across the board.

## 6. Power BI Dashboard

The final step was pulling everything into a Power BI dashboard (Ecommerce_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix). The dashboard is designed to give a business user a quick read on performance without needing to dig through spreadsheets.

**Dashboard sections:**

- **Executive Overview** — KPI cards for Revenue, Profit, Orders, and ROAS at a glance
- **Revenue Trend** — Monthly and quarterly line charts showing revenue and profit over time
- **Category & Region Breakdown** — Bar charts comparing performance across product categories and geographies
- **Customer Segmentation** — RFM segment distribution with count and revenue contribution per segment
- **Ad Performance** — CTR, CPC, and ROAS metrics filtered by category and region

All visuals are connected to slicers for Year, Quarter, Category, and Region — so you can drill down into any combination without writing a query.

## 7. Key Insights & Recommendations

**What's working:**

ROAS of 5.01x is solid — for every dollar spent on ads, $5 is coming back in revenue. Electronics is the top revenue driver, but Clothing is the most efficient from a margin perspective at 54.4%.

The customer base is relatively healthy — 36% of customers fall into Champion or Loyal segments, meaning there's a strong repeat buyer base to build on.

**What needs attention:**

The "Cannot Lose" and "At Risk" segments together are about 2,700 customers. These are likely high-value individuals showing disengagement. A targeted retention campaign — even something simple like a personalized email with a limited-time offer — could have meaningful revenue impact.

Home Appliances has the lowest margin at 36.5% and is probably carrying higher ad costs. Worth doing a deeper dive into CPC and conversion rates for that category specifically.

**Suggested next steps:**

1. Build a cohort analysis to track how retention rates change over time by acquisition month.
2. Run A/B test simulations on discount levels — the data has a Discount_Applied field which could be mined to see if higher discounts are actually driving incremental revenue or just cutting into margin.
3. Add a product-level analysis — currently everything is at category level, but drilling into the 1,000 individual products would reveal which SKUs are driving performance and which are dragging it down.
4. Predictive CLV model — with the RFM scores as a base, building a simple lifetime value predictor would be a natural next extension of this project.
